# Basic_Calculator 
## Introduction 
A Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. It makes our calculations easier and faster. It is a portable device that can use anywhere to perform simple mathematical operations.


# Research :-
We use a scientific or sophisticated calculator in some situations, where we need to solve complex calculations like trigonometry functions, exponential operators, degrees, radians, log functions, hyperbolic functions etc

## **BENEFITS:**
a) Record Maintenance.

b) Web-Based Solution.

c) Saves Time and Cost.

d) Secure and Reliable.

e) Increases Efficiency.

f) Simple and Easy to Use.


# Cost and Features and Timeline :-




## a)	10 years Ago Calculator

- This is the old version of calculator
- They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas)
- It as used to perform the basic operation like (+, -, /, *)
- It will cost you around 100Rs

## b)  5 years Ago Calculator 

- Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers
- The end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools (300Rs)

## c)  	New Generation Calculator 

- Power sources of calculators are batteries, solar cells or mains electricity (for old models), turning on with a switch or button
- We can perform the all basic operation (+,-,/,*,%) along with trigonometric operations etc
- It will cost you around (500rs) depends more features

# Defining Our System :-
This is the Basic calculator which is manufactured by Cisco. Which is used for basic operations like Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,  Square root.

# SWOT ANALYSIS :-
SWOT Analysis is a simple tool that can help you to analyze what your company does best right now, and to devise a successful strategy for the future. SWOT can also reveal areas of the business that are holding you back, or that your competitors could exploit if you don't protect yourself.

## a) Strengths 
Strengths are things that your Calculators does particularly well, or in a way that distinguishes you from your competitors
## b) Weaknesses
Weaknesses, like strengths, are inherent features of your projects, so focus on your people, resources, systems, and procedures. 
## c)  Opportunity
They usually arise from situations outside your organization, and require an eye to what might happen in the future.   
## d) Threats 
Threats include anything that can negatively affect your business from the outside, such as supply-chain problems, shifts in market requirements, or a shortage of recruits.

 ## High Level Requirements






 | ID     | Description                |
 | :------- | :------------------------- |
 | HLR1|  It is a basic calculator which support basic operations like (+, -, *, /)                          |
 | HLR2|  In feature it will also supports Financial operations (simple interest etc) |
 | HLR3|  If we not choices it will let you to perform the calculation operation. |

## LOW Level Requirements
